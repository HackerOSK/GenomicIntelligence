# 🧬 Large Language Models in Precision Medicine: Transforming Genomic Data Analysis for Personalized Therapies

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** can be integrated with **genomic data, pathology reports, and medical knowledge** to deliver **personalized treatment suggestions**. It features a web-based healthcare assistant that recommends therapies, medicines, and precautions using both allopathy and homeopathy perspectives.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Extract structured information from pathology reports using AI.
- Analyze user-specific genomic and personal health data.
- Suggest **personalized therapies** based on real-time queries.
- Offer recommendations via **two specialized AI agents**:
  - Allopathy Agent
  - Homeopathy Agent
- Enhance patient engagement through a modern web interface with a **mind-blowing user experience**.

---

## 🧠 Key Innovations
- **Multi-Agent AI Framework**: Two distinct agents for allopathy and homeopathy, each trained or fine-tuned on different knowledge bases.
- **Genomic & Medical NER Pipeline**: Extracts entities from pathology reports using models like BioBERT.
- **Therapy Ranking Algorithm**: Uses MCDM (e.g., AHP or TOPSIS) to score and rank treatment options.
- **Digital Health Twin**: Simulates a user's health profile and maps therapy impact over time.
- **Evidence + Holistic Blending**: Combines medical literature (PubMed, UMLS) with traditional homeopathy sources (repertories).

## 🛠️ System Architecture

### 1. **Input System**
- OCR for PDF/Scanned Pathology Reports
- NER using BioBERT/ClinicalBERT to extract:
  - Diseases
  - Gene mutations
  - Symptoms
  - Lab values
- User Profile:
  - Age, Gender, Weight, Lifestyle
  - Genomic markers (optional)

### 2. **Embedding + Knowledge Mapping**
- Entity Linking to:
  - dbSNP
  - ClinVar
  - KEGG Pathways
- Convert extracted data to dense vector representations

### 3. **Routing Agent**
- User chooses Allopathy or Homeopathy, or AI decides based on query.
- Routes the prompt and data to appropriate agent.

### 4. **Allopathy Agent**
- Sources: PubMed, Clinical Trials, FDA, WHO
- Uses LLM + Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Therapy suggestions include:
  - Drugs
  - Doses
  - Side Effects
  - Contraindications

### 5. **Homeopathy Agent**
- Sources: Repertories, Homeopathy Books, Boenninghausen’s method
- Uses symptom-similarity based inference
- Suggests:
  - Remedies
  - Potency & Frequency
  - Lifestyle advice

### 6. **Therapy Ranking Algorithm**
- Scoring based on:
  - Efficacy (Evidence)
  - Compatibility (Genetics)
  - Safety Profile
  - Cost

### 7. **LLM Chat Interface**
- User interacts with chatbot for Q&A
- Backend uses LangChain / OpenAI API / Custom LLMs
- Returns text, tables, or visual summaries

## 🖥️ Web App Workflow

### Step 1: Upload Reports & Fill Profile
- OCR + AI parses data
- Store in user-specific secure storage

### Step 2: Choose Treatment Preference
- Allopathy
- Homeopathy
- Hybrid/AI Recommended

### Step 3: Ask Questions
- E.g., *"What are my therapy options?"*
- Agent responds with personalized suggestions

### Step 4: Visualize Suggestions
- Treatment cards (Allopathy vs Homeopathy)
- Risk scores, confidence level, gene mapping
- Compare therapies side-by-side

### Step 5: Save or Export
- Download summary PDF
- Share with physician

## 🎨 UX Highlights
- **Doctor Avatar Chat UI** (different avatar for each agent)
- **Step-by-step intake form** with progress bar
- **Dynamic Therapy Cards** with expandable info
- **Light/Dark Mode + Mobile Responsive Design**
- **Voice Input** + **Avatar Speech Output (optional)**
